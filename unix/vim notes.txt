hey there
this is the vim editor
I will put you into insert mode
esc key will take you out of it
:q is quit when you are outside the insert mode                                                                           :w is write when you are outside insert mode. this is how we save the file                                                :wq is write and quit. it is a shortcut for the top two 
:q! means that you want to quit and cancel the changes
