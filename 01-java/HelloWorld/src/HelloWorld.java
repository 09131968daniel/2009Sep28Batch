 * why java?

WORA = Write Once Run Anywhere
OOP language
Strictly typed
modular
Been around for long enough
widely used
strong backing from oracle
automatic garbage collection


jdk = java development kit, minimum needed to write java code. holds the compiler and the jre.
jre = java runtime environment, holds the jvm and core libraries. minimum needed to run a java program.
jvm = java virtual machine allows java compiled into bytecode to run on any machine.

OOP is the programming paradigm that views everything as objects

there are 4 pillars to oop
A = abstraction -> hiding the implementation or logic, we dont care how its done, as long as it is done
P = polymorphism -> The ability to differ in the same ability. Do something different, even though it is the same action.
I = Inheritance -> class based inheritance, classes inherit traits and properties from its parent
E = Encapsulation -> restricting direct access to data

a class is a blueprint for an object, an object is the building blocks of a program
