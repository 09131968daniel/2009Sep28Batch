Creating a react project
npx create-react-app <filename> --template typescript

package.json contains the information about the project. 
react and react-dom are the libraries for working with React api. 
react-dom lets us use react in the browser
react-scripts help run projects like on a development server
@types/jest, @types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom: different repositories that tell the project how to run the javascript
- the @types repo specifies these things. 

you have one html file in your entire application, within the root element

we start developing within app.tsx
app.css is just css, use it in app.tsx with import app.css

npm run start //to start your application
-starts a node server, bundle it up, and make it available
- the default port of a react application is 3000, so localhost:3000
