/*
use npm to create a javascript project. 
npm init
then just press enter all the way through lol
it creates package.json


use npm to add dependencies
npm install typescript from within the project to add typescript dependency
- this creates package-lock and a node-modules


always have a .gitignore in the package to ignore node-modules because
node-modules are hugeeeeee. if you try to push node-modules it'll take forever! 

later when you clone a repositroy and you don't have the node-modules in it, just run
npm -i and it will look through your package.json and install everything you need.
