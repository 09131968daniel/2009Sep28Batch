--isolation levels

--ACID, the i stands for isolation
----isolated = transactions will not conflict with each other

--						dirty read			Nonrepeatable Read				Phantom Read					Serialization Anomaly
--read uncommitted			O						O							 O									 O
--read committed			X						O							 O									 O
--repeatable read			X						X							 O(not in postgres)					 O
--serializable				X						X							 X									 X

--note: postgresql does not allow read uncommitted as an isolation level, read committed is the minimum
--note: postgres does not allow phantom reads in a repeatable read
