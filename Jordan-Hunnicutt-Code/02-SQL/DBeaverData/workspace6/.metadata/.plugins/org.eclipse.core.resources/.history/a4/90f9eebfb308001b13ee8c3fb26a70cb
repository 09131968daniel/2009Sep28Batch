----JOINS
--joins will bring tables together at the columns.
select * from "Track" join "Genre" on "Track"."GenreId" = "Genre"."GenreId";
select "Track"."Name", "Genre"."Name" from "Track" join "Genre" on "Track"."GenreId" = "Genre"."GenreId";

--different types of joins
----inner join, outer join (left outer, right outer, full outer), self, cross, cartesian

--inner join
select * from "Track" join "Album" on "Track"."AlbumId" = "Album"."AlbumId";
select * from "Track" inner join "Album" on "Track"."AlbumId" = "Album"."AlbumId";

--right outer
select * from "Album" right join "Artist" on "Album"."ArtistId" = "Artist"."ArtistId";

--left outer
select * from "Album" left join "Artist" on "Album"."ArtistId" = "Artist"."ArtistId";

--full outer
select * from "Album" full join "Artist" on "Album"."ArtistId" = "Artist"."ArtistId";

--some different ways to write inner joins
select * from "Album" a join "Artist" b on a."ArtistId" = b."ArtistId";
select * from "Album" a, "Artist"b where a."ArtistId" = b."ArtistId";

--self join
select * from "Album"a, "Album"b where a."AlbumId" = b."AlbumId";

--cross join
select * from "Album"a cross join "Artist"b; --takes every record from album table, and joins it with every record from artist table
--this is the join you will probably never use, ever less so than self join
