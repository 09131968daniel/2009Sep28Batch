------sequences
--a sequence will begin a sequence of numbers and keep track of the current value.
----to use the values, we can use nextval('seq_name') to get a unique value.

--behind the scenes, serial uses a sequence to increment
--we can customize by starting with whatever number and changing it how we like
create sequence seq5 start 5 increment by 5;

select nextval('seq5');

create sequence start6 start 6;

select nextval('start6');
