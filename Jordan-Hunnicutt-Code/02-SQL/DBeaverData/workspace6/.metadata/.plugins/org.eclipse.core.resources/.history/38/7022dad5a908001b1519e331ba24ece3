-------------NORMALIZATION
--normalization is the way that we can organize our data to reduce redundancy and provide better optimization

--normalization is made up by many normal forms
----these are the forms for the tables

--first normal form (1nf)
----each row of data must have a unique identifier
----each row must have atomic values (granularizing the data) (different from atomic in acid)
--example:
----a table with an address column
------insert into address_table values ('555 55th street indianapolis, IN 44444');   <- bad
----with first normal form:
------insert into address (1, 555, '55th street', 'Indianapolis', 'IN', 44444); <- better (easier and faster to query)
