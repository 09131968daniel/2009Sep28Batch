/*
 * Why Java? 
 * WORA = Write Once Run Anywhere
 * OOP language
 * Strictly typed
 * Modular
 * Been around for long enough 
 * Widely used
 * Strong backing from Oracle
 * Automatic garbage collection
 * 
 * jdk = java development kit, minimum needed to write java code. Holds the compiler and the jre.
 * jre = java runtime environment, holds the jvm and core libraries. Minimum needed to run a java program.
 * jvm = java virtual machine allows java compiled into bytecode to run on any machine
 * 
 * OOP is the programming paradigm that views everything as objects
 * 
 * there are 4 pillars to OOP
 * A- abstraction -> hiding the implementation or logic, we don't care how it's done, as long as it is done
 * P- polymorphism -> the ability to differ in the same ability. Do something different, even though it is the same action.
 * I- inheritance -> class based inheritance, classes inherit traits and properties from its parent
 * E- encapsulation -> restricting direct access to data
 * 
 * a class is a blueprint for an object, an object is the building blocks or a program
